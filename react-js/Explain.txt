Java => Spring Boot (MVC)
Python => DJango , Flask (MVC)
PhP ==> Laravel (MVC)
C# => .Net (MVC)
Javascript => Express Js (MVC) , Angular (MVVM) , Vue

M = Model , V = View , C = Controller

React Js  (View) => React is library of JavaScript , User Interface

# React Works On State Mechanism
# React Only refresh only portion of the page which required to update.
# React application are single page applications
# React syntactic events
# React has its own DOM ==> VDom (it improve application performance)
# In react we only have one way data binding.
# In React we can performance Server Side Rendering (SSR) and Client Side Rendering (CSR)
# React can be use with or without class logic
# React can be customized. (attached a library)
# Testing react application is a simple.
# Migration from one version to other is easy in react 


// boilerplate code project (facebook)

work with react for development environment we need Node JS

Node JS as development server for use

development (development) ==> production (we don't need node js)

package ==> lib , framework , single file
NPM  => Node Package Manager ==> add , delete , update , published , unpublished
NPX => Node Package Executor => add ==> run ==> delete

to install react app bellow is a command
project-name ==> small case , it must not have space
npx create-react-app project-name

Installing 
    react ==> core library,
    react-dom ==> browser dev,
    react-native ==> Mobil Development
    react-scripts ==> runs react app , test react , build react aoo
        with cra-template...

react states , props , components , map in react

public
    .html
    images
    .icon
    .json
    .txt
src
    css
    js
    background_images
    fonts
    testing
package.json

src ==> entry file (index.js)


import 
    ==> Object

function / class

export 
    ==> Object
    ==> function/string/number/array/class

App.js => Component 
    :: Basic Building Block
    :: Component must start with capital latter
    :: Component export 
    :: In file you may have multiple components

    import (option)
    function/class
    export 

    function ==> it must have a return keyword
        # in return that is not a html element
        # JSX ==> Javascript XML
        # JSX rule
            # JSX will always have one parent element
            # IF you don't want to use JSX element you can use <></> i.e JSX fragment
            # class ==> className
            # for ==> htmlFor
            # if you want to use javascript code ==> { js code }
            # if else are only posable by ternary operator (cond) ? true : false;
            # loop ==> map method od array
            # style="background-color:red;color:green"  ==>  style={{ backgroundColor:'red',color:'green' }}

Hooks
States & props
Single Source Of Truth


ml ---> ms
mr ---> me

pl --> ps
pr --> pe

panel --> card
--> Display-1 ... Display-5

class ==> className
for ==> htmlFor

Hooks ==> in-build 
      ==> custom hooks
      ==> 3rd party hooks
    
    hooks always starts with ==> useName 
    hooks can only be use in function component

if you want to do the data mang in react component ==> state
when ever state changes ===> component re-renders
states are mutable in nature
in FN component ===> hooks ===> useState()

useState ==> in return ==> [value,updateDataFunction]
value can be ==> a number , a string , a [] , a {} , a boolean
updateDataFunction ==> function

// ToDo List
    Input 
    Button

    list 
        title
        isCompleted
        deleteA todo
        editTodo

# if we want to use a loop in react we use a map method of array
# in react for "if .. else" we use ternary operator ==>   (condition) ? trueCode : falseCode
